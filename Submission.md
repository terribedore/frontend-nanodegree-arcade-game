# Project Submission
Download the [visual assets and a game loop engine](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). Then, using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger (or if you are inspired, you can make your own game! Just be sure to follow all rubric requirements for game functions).
